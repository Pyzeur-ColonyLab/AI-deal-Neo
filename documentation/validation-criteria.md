# Validation Criteria

**Version:** v1.0.0
**Approval Status:** Draft

## 1. Test Scenarios for Each Requirement

- All API endpoints return correct responses for valid requests.
- Unauthorized requests are rejected.
- AI model responses are returned within 60 seconds (99% of cases).
- System logs all requests and errors.
- Health endpoint returns correct status.
- System passes security and compliance checks.

## 2. Acceptance Test Definitions

- Functional tests for /api/v1/chat and /api/v1/health endpoints.
- Functional tests for model management endpoints (/api/v1/models, /api/v1/models/{id}/load, /api/v1/models/{id}/unload).
- Functional tests for model downloading endpoint (/api/v1/models/download).
- Security tests for authentication and input validation.
- Performance tests to ensure 60-second response time is not exceeded.
- Reliability tests for uptime and error handling.
- Model management tests to ensure proper model loading/unloading behavior.
- Domain and SSL configuration tests to ensure proper HTTPS setup.
- Swagger UI integration tests to verify API documentation functionality.
- System administration tests to verify cleanup, purging, and monitoring functionality.
- Model parameter management tests to verify configuration, updates, and validation.
- Model format compatibility tests for different model types.
- Download progress tracking and error handling tests.
- Domain accessibility tests for cryptomaltese.com.
- SSL certificate validation and HTTPS enforcement tests.
- Swagger UI functionality and accessibility tests.
- System cleanup operations and resource management tests.
- Log purging functionality and space recovery tests.
- System status monitoring and health check tests.
- Model parameter management and configuration tests.
